You can reach the [h-bridge](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/circuits/H_bridge.PNG), [rotational velocity feedback](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/circuits/Rotational%20Velocity%20Feedback.PNG) and [current feedback](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/circuits/Current%20Feedback.PNG) circuits

You can reach the example ccs c codes for [analog reading](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/ccs-c-codes/AnalogRead.c), [constant pwm output](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/ccs-c-codes/ConstantPwmOut.c) and [serial communication with debounce](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/ccs-c-codes/SerialDebounce.c). Serial to PWM signal code is also uploaded to [here.](https://github.com/ikcmechatronics/ikcmechatronics.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Control/ccs-c-codes/ReadStringToPwm.c)
